## My R Journey

1. 5 years struggling with SPSS
2. 5 years of glorious R.

## Why is R so great?

1. Free and open source
2. Statistics (duh)
3. Plotting
4. Simulations
5. Replication and Sharing
6. Writing reports and APA documents
7. Contributing to the R community
8. Bonuses!!

## Free and open source

- Unlike SPSS or Matlab, you can always get access to R
- Great free add ons like RStudio which make it easy.

--- .class #id 
## Statistics

### Basics
- Hypothesis tests
- Regression, ANOVA

### Advanced
- Bayesian Statistics
- Heirarchical models

--- .class #id 
## Plotting

- Graphics are like designer cars, when it's made by a great manufacturer (like R), you can see it. When it's made cheaply, (like SPSS), you can see that too.

1. SPSS Barplot vs. R pirateplot
2. SPSS scatterplot vs R scatterplot
3. R network plot
4. Fun plots: balloon plot


--- .class #id 
## Simulations

- Do you want to understand what a p-value is? Do a simulation!
- Do you want to know what predictions your theory makes? Do a simulation?

--- .class #id 
## Replication and Sharing

- Unlike SPSS, with R, all of your analysis is documented in code.
- No need to 'remember' what analyses you did.

--- .class #id 
## Writing documents and APA style papers

- Easily write reports that combine data, code, results, and test.
- Did you know that you can write APA style papers with R?

--- .class #id 
## Bonuses!

1. Create HTML presentations (like this one!) with `slidify`
2. Show interactive data and write experiments with Shiny
3. Contribute to R by creating your own R packages
